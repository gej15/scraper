## What Is It

This website scrapes articles from another website and puts them into this one. One can also save the articles and add notes to them.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After module installation is complete and MongoDB is running, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.
